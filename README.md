Assignment description: Process loan data and build classification algorithms to predict the default rate. Perform data wrangling and premilinary analysis and visualization. Use traing and test datasets to evaluate each classification algorithm including: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. Evaluate methods include: Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss.
